The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake in the candidate solution is the claim that $BD = CD$. This claim is not true in general. While it is true that $BD = CD$ in an isosceles triangle, the triangle $ABC$ is not necessarily isosceles.

Therefore, the candidate solution is flawed from the beginning and does not lead to the correct conclusion. I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
