The provided solution does not address any aspect of the given problem. It does not mention the function f, its 'aquaesulian' property, or the expression f(r) + f(-r). \\n\\nBecause the submission solves a different problem, it makes no progress towards the stated goal of the actual problem. Therefore, it receives a score of 0. This appears to be a case of the student solving the wrong problem by mistake.\"\n}\n```"
