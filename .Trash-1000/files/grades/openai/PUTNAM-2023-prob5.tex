The first mistake in the student's solution is in the simplification of the second sum. The student incorrectly multiplied $-2$ to each term inside the sum, which resulted in incorrect coefficients for each term. This mistake propagates through the rest of the solution, leading to an incorrect final expression for $S$. 

Overall, the student's solution lacks rigor in the simplification of the sums and does not provide a clear and complete evaluation of the sum $S$. Therefore, I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.
