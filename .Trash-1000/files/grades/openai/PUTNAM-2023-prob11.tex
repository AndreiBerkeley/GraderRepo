The student's solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the proof that all powers of 2 satisfy the given property. The mistake occurs when the student defines the permutation $\pi$ for $n = 2^k$. The permutation defined by $\pi(i) = 2i$ for $1 \leq i \leq 2^{k-1}$ and $\pi(i) = 2i - 2^{k}$ for $2^{k-1} < i \leq 2^{k}$ does not satisfy the given property for all $m$ relatively prime to $n$. 

For example, if we take $m = 3$ and $n = 2^2 = 4$, then the permutation $\pi$ defined by $\pi(i) = 2i$ for $1 \leq i \leq 2^{2-1} = 2$ and $\pi(i) = 2i - 2^{2} = 2i - 4$ for $2^{2-1} < i \leq 2^{2} = 4$ does not satisfy $\pi(\pi(k)) \equiv mk \pmod{n}$ for all $k \in \{1,2,3,4\}$.

Therefore, the correct conclusion that all powers of 2 satisfy the given property is not proven in the student's solution. 

Overall, I would rate this solution a 3 out of 5.
