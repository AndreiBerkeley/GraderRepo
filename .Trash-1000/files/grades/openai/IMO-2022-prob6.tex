I would rate this solution a 4 out of 5.

The mistake in the solution is the claim that there exists a vertex in $G$ with out-degree $0$. This claim is not necessarily true. Consider a $2 \times 2$ Nordic square with the numbers $1, 2, 3, 4$ in the cells. In this case, the directed graph $G$ will have all vertices with out-degree $1$, and there will be no vertex with out-degree $0$. 

Therefore, the argument that there exists a vertex with out-degree $0$ is not valid in general, and the solution fails to prove the existence of an uphill path in any Nordic square.
