To find the points of intersection between the line $y = ax + b$ and the curve $y = \ln(1+x^2)$, we need to solve the system of equations
\begin{align*}
ax + b &= \ln(1+x^2) \\
y &= \ln(1+x^2).
\end{align*}

Substitute the second equation into the first to get
\begin{align*}
ax + b &= y \\
ax + b &= \ln(1+x^2).
\end{align*}

Since the line intersects the curve in exactly one point, the two equations above must represent the same line. Therefore, we have
\begin{align*}
a &= 1 \\
b &= 0.
\end{align*}

Hence, the only ordered pair of real numbers $(a,b)$ such that the line $y = ax + b$ intersects the curve $y = \ln(1+x^2)$ in exactly one point is $(1,0)$.
