Let \( n! = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_m^{a_m} \) be the prime factorization of \( n! \), where \( p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_m \) are prime numbers and \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m \) are positive integers. 

The divisors of \( n! \) are precisely the numbers of the form \( p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \cdots p_m^{b_m} \), where \( 0 \leq b_i \leq a_i \) for each \( i \). 

Let \( d_i = p_1^{b_{i1}} p_2^{b_{i2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{im}} \) be the \( i \)-th divisor of \( n! \) in the list. Then, we have \( 0 \leq b_{i1} \leq a_1, 0 \leq b_{i2} \leq a_2, \dots, 0 \leq b_{im} \leq a_m \) for each \( i \).

The condition \( d_2 - d_1 \leq d_3 - d_2 \leq \dots \leq d_k - d_{k-1} \) can be rewritten as
\[
p_1^{b_{21}} p_2^{b_{22}} \cdots p_m^{b_{2m}} - p_1^{b_{11}} p_2^{b_{12}} \cdots p_m^{b_{1m}} \leq p_1^{b_{31}} p_2^{b_{32}} \cdots p_m^{b_{3m}} - p_1^{b_{21}} p_2^{b_{22}} \cdots p_m^{b_{2m}} \leq \dots \leq p_1^{b_{k1}} p_2^{b_{k2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{km}} - p_1^{b_{(k-1)1}} p_2^{b_{(k-1)2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{(k-1)m}}.
\]

This simplifies to
\[
p_1^{b_{21}} p_2^{b_{22}} \cdots p_m^{b_{2m}} (p_1^{b_{22}-b_{12}} p_2^{b_{22}-b_{12}} \cdots p_m^{b_{2m}-b_{1m}} - 1) \leq p_1^{b_{31}} p_2^{b_{32}} \cdots p_m^{b_{3m}} (p_1^{b_{32}-b_{22}} p_2^{b_{32}-b_{22}} \cdots p_m^{b_{3m}-b_{2m}} - 1) \leq \dots \leq p_1^{b_{k1}} p_2^{b_{k2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{km}} (p_1^{b_{k2}-b_{(k-1)2}} p_2^{b_{k2}-b_{(k-1)2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{km}-b_{(k-1)m}} - 1).
\]

Since \( p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_m \), the term \( p_1^{b_{i1}} p_2^{b_{i2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{im}} \) is strictly increasing as \( i \) increases. Therefore, in order for the above inequalities to hold, it must be the case that for each \( i \), the term \( p_1^{b_{i2}-b_{(i-1)2}} p_2^{b_{i2}-b_{(i-1)2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{im}-b_{(i-1)m}} - 1 \) is non-decreasing as \( i \) increases.

This implies that for each \( i \), we must have \( b_{i2} - b_{(i-1)2} \geq 0, b_{i3} - b_{(i-1)3} \geq 0, \dots, b_{im} - b_{(i-1)m} \geq 0 \). In other words, for each prime \( p_j \), the exponent of \( p_j \) in the prime factorization of the divisors must be
