  "feedback": "The parity argument with n = 2 correctly shows that every admissible k must be even.  \nHowever, the proof that every even k works is incorrect.  In the polynomial\nP(x) = [(1+x)^n (1+x^{-1})^n]^m the constant term is not equal to Σ_{i=0}^{n} (binom{n}{i})^{2m}; many mixed terms with indices (i_1,j_1),…,(i_m,j_m) whose exponents cancel also contribute.  Already for n = 1, k = 4 this constant term equals 6, while Σ binom{1}{i}^4 = 2, showing the claimed equality fails.  Hence the divisibility for even k is not established, and the solution is incomplete."
