The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the step where the candidate solution divides both sides of the equation by 2 to obtain
\[a^n + \frac{3}{2}b^n = 2^{2n-1}k^n.\]
This step is incorrect because dividing both sides by 2 does not give the correct form of the equation. The correct form should be
\[a^n + \frac{3}{2}b^n = 2^{2n-1}k^{n-1}.\]
This mistake leads to errors in the subsequent manipulations and conclusions. Therefore, the candidate solution is not fully correct and rigorous.
