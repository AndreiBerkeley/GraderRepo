A good hint would point towards a key configuration or property without giving away the main steps of the solution.\n\nOne of the key properties of the construction is the relationship between the incenter $I$ and the triangle $\\triangle DFE$.\n- $DE \\perp BI$. Since $F$ is on $BI$, $DE \\perp IF$.\n- $DF \\perp CI$. Since $E$ is on $CI$, $DF \\perp IE$.\nThese two conditions mean that $I$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle DFE$. This is a crucial first step. From this, it follows that $DI \\perp EF$. This perpendicularity is essential for relating the reflection of $A$ across $EF$ to the rest of the geometric figure.\n\nA hint pointing towards this direction would be appropriate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"The submission is empty.

Consider the relationship between the incenter $I$ and $\\\\triangle DFE$ based on the perpendicularity conditions given in the problem statement.
