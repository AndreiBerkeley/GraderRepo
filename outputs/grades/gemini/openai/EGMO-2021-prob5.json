The argument is clear, logically structured, and correct in every detail.\\n\\nThe key steps are brilliantly executed:\\n1.  You correctly identify the geometric condition for a triangle to be fat in terms of the angular span of its vertices.\\n2.  The strategy of minimizing the number of non-fat ('bad') triangles is excellent.\\n3.  The method of counting non-fat triangles by partitioning them based on their unique 'first' vertex in the clockwise ordering is very clever and is the cornerstone of the proof. The identity Σ f(i) = C(n,2) is derived beautifully from this.\\n4.  You correctly apply the principle of convexity (via Jensen's or Karamata's inequality) to find the minimum value of Σ C(f(i),2) by making the f(i) values as equal as possible.\\n5.  Crucially, you demonstrate that this minimum is achievable with a concrete geometric configuration (the vertices of a regular 2021-gon), which also satisfies the problem's non-degeneracy conditions.\\n\\nYour work is equivalent to a full proof of a known result in tournament theory (maximizing cyclic triples) but derived from geometric first principles, which is very impressive. The calculations are also accurate. This is a model solution.\"\n}\n```"
