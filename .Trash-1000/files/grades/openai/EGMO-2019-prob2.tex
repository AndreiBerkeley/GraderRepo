I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the assumption that each black cell contributes to the placement of exactly $1$ domino. This assumption is incorrect because each domino covers one black cell and one white cell, not two black cells. Therefore, the conclusion that the number of dominoes placed on the board is equal to the number of black cells is incorrect.

The correct approach is to consider the auras of the dominoes as shown in the official solution, and use the information about the auras on the boundary to derive the correct formula for the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board.
