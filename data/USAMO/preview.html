Fix positive integers $k$ and $d$. Prove that for all sufficiently large odd positive integers $n$, the digits of the base-$2n$ representation of $n^k$ are all greater than $d$.

The problem actually doesn't have much to do with digits: the idea is to pick any length $\ell \le k$, and look at the rightmost $\ell$ digits of $n^k$; that is, the remainder upon division by $(2n)^\ell$. We compute it exactly:

Let $n \ge 1$ be an odd integer, and $k \ge \ell \ge 1$ integers. Then
\[
n^k \bmod{(2n)^\ell} = c(k,\ell) \cdot n^\ell
\]
for some odd integer $1 \le c(k,\ell) \le 2^\ell-1$.

This follows directly by the Chinese remainder theorem, with $c(k,\ell)$ being the residue class of $n^{k-\ell} \pmod{2^\ell}$ (which makes sense because $n$ was odd).

In particular, for the $\ell$th digit from the right to be greater than $d$, it would be enough that
\[
c(k,\ell) \cdot n^\ell \ge (d+1) \cdot (2n)^{\ell-1}.
\]
But this inequality holds whenever $n \ge (d+1) \cdot 2^{\ell-1}$.

Putting this together by varying $\ell$, we find that for all odd
\[
n \ge (d+1) \cdot 2^{k-1}
\]
we have that

– $n^k$ has $k$ digits in base-$2n$; and

– for each $\ell = 1, \dots, k$, the $\ell$th digit from the right is at least $d+1$

so the problem is solved.

Note it doesn't really matter that $c(k,\ell)$ is odd per se; we only need that $c(k,\ell) \ge 1$.

Prove that $P(x)$ has a nonreal root.

By considering any $k+1$ of the roots of $P$, we may as well assume WLOG that $n = k+1$. Suppose that $P(x) = (x+r_1) \dots (x+r_n) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ has $P(0) \neq 0$. Then the problem hypothesis is that each of the $n$ polynomials (of degree $n-1$) given by
\[
\begin{align*}
  P_1(x) &= (x+r_2)(x+r_3)(x+r_4) \dots (x+r_n), \\
  P_2(x) &= (x+r_1)(x+r_3)(x+r_4) \dots (x+r_n), \\
  P_3(x) &= (x+r_1)(x+r_2)(x+r_4) \dots (x+r_n), \\
  &\vdots \\
  P_n(x) &= (x+r_1)(x+r_2)(x+r_3) \dots (x+r_{n-1})
\end{align*}
\]
has at least one coefficient equal to zero. (Explicitly, $P_i(x) = \frac{P(x)}{x+r_i}$.) We'll prove that at least one $r_i$ is not real.

Obviously the leading and constant coefficients of each $P_i$ are nonzero, and there are $n-2$ other coefficients to choose between. So by pigeonhole principle, we may assume, say, that $P_1$ and $P_2$ share the position of a zero coefficient, say the $x^k$ one, for some $1 \le k < n-1$.

Alice the architect and Bob the builder play a game.
First, Alice chooses two points $P$ and $Q$ in the plane
and a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of the plane, which are announced to Bob.
Next, Bob marks infinitely many points in the plane,
designating each a city.
He may not place two cities within distance at most one unit of each other,
and no three cities he places may be collinear.
Finally, roads are constructed between the cities as follows:
each pair $A$, $B$ of cities is connected with a road along the line segment $AB$
if and only if the following condition holds:

For every city $C$ distinct from $A$ and $B$,
there exists $R\in \mathcal{S}$ such that $\triangle PQR$ is directly similar
to either $\triangle ABC$ or $\triangle BAC$.

Alice wins the game if (i) the resulting roads allow for travel
between any pair of cities via a finite sequence of roads and (ii) no two roads cross.
Otherwise, Bob wins. Determine, with proof, which player has a winning strategy.

The answer is that Alice wins.
Let's define a Bob-set $V$ to be a set of points in the plane with no three collinear
and with all distances at least $1$.
The point of the problem is to prove the following fact.
\begin{claim*}
  Given a Bob-set $V \subseteq \RR^2$, consider the Bob-graph
  with vertex set $V$ defined as follows:
  draw edge $ab$ if and only if the disk with diameter $\overline{ab}$
  contains no other points of $V$ on or inside it.
  Then the Bob-graph is (i) connected, and (ii) planar.
\end{claim*}
Proving this claim shows that Alice wins since Alice can specify $\mathcal{S}$
to be the set of points outside the disk of diameter $PQ$.

\begin{proof}
  Assume for contradiction the graph is disconnected.
  Let $p$ and $q$ be two points in different connected components.
  Since $pq$ is not an edge, there exists a third point $r$
  inside the disk with diameter $\overline{pq}$.

  Hence, $r$ is in a different connected component
  from at least one of $p$ or $q$ --- let's</div>

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{QC}$.

– Point $M$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle AFP$.

It's clear that $MA = MP$ from the isosceles trapezoid. As for $MA = MF$, let $N$ denote the midpoint of $\overline{AF}$; then $\overline{MN}$ is a midline of the parallelogram, so $\overline{MN} \perp \overline{AF}$.

Since $\overline{CM} \perp \overline{BC}$ and $M$ is the center of $(AFP)$, it follows $CX = CY$.

Find all positive integers $k$ such that:
for every positive integer $n$,
the sum \[ \binom n0^k + \binom n1^k + \dots + \binom nn^k \] is divisible by $n+1$.

The answer is all even $k$.

Let's abbreviate $S(n) := \binom n0^k + \dots + \binom nn^k$ for the sum in the problem.

\textbf{Proof that even $k$ is necessary.}\par 
Choose $n=2$. We need $3 \mid S(2) = 2+2^k$,
which requires $k$ to be even.

– It's actually not much more difficult to just use $n = p-1$ for prime $p$,
  since $\binom{p-1}{i} \equiv (-1)^i \pmod p$.
  Hence $S(p-1) \equiv 1 + (-1)^k + 1 + (-1)^k + \dots + 1 \pmod p$,
  and this also requires $k$ to be even.
  This special case is instructive in figuring out the proof to follow.

\textbf{Proof that $k$ is sufficient.}\par 
From now on we treat $k$ as fixed, and we let $p^e$ be a prime fully dividing $n+1$.
The basic idea is to reduce from $n+1$ to $(n+1)/p$ by an induction.

– Here is a concrete illustration that makes it clear what's going on.
  Let $p = 5$.
  When $n = p-1 = 4$, we have
  \[ S(4) = 1^k + 4^k + 6^k + 4^k + 1^k \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod 5. \]
  When $n = p^2-1 = 24$, the $25$ terms of $S(24)$ in order are, modulo $25$,
  \begin{align*}
    S(24)  \equiv 1^k + 1^k + 1^k + 1^k + 1^k

Prove that it is possible to distribute the $m$ cupcakes to the $n$ people so that each person $P$ receives cupcakes of total score at least $1$ with respect to $P$.

Arbitrarily pick any one person — call her Pip — and her $n$ arcs. The initial idea is to try to apply Hall's marriage lemma to match the $n$ people with Pip's arcs (such that each such person is happy with their matched arc). To that end, construct the obvious bipartite graph $\mathfrak{G}$ between the people and the arcs for Pip.

We now consider the following algorithm, which takes several steps.

– If a perfect matching of $\mathfrak{G}$ exists, we're done!

– We're probably not that lucky. Per Hall's condition, this means there is a bad set $\mathcal{B}_1$ of people, who are compatible with fewer than $|\mathcal{B}_1|$ of the arcs. Then delete $\mathcal{B}_1$ and the neighbors of $\mathcal{B}_1$, then try to find a matching on the remaining graph.

– If a matching exists now, terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, that means there's another bad set $\mathcal{B}_2$ for the remaining graph. We again delete $\mathcal{B}_2$ and the fewer than $\mathcal{B}_2$ neighbors.

– Repeat until some perfect matching $\mathcal{M}$ is possible in the remaining graph, i.e. there are no more bad sets (and then terminate once that occurs).

Since Pip is a universal vertex, it's impossible to delete Pip, so the algorithm does indeed terminate with nonempty $\mathcal{M}$.

We commit to assigning each of person in $\mathcal{M}$ their matched arc (in particular if there are no bad sets at all, the problem is already solved).</div>
