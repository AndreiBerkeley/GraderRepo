I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the solution is the claim that $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ are collinear. This claim is not true in general. The correct claim is that $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ are concurrent, which is a consequence of the fact that lines $AA_1$, $BB_1$, and $CC_1$ are concurrent at a point $P$. 

The rest of the solution is correct and provides a valid proof for the concurrency of lines $AA_2$, $BB_2$, and $CC_2$ at a point $Q$, which implies that the circumcircles of triangles $AA_1A_2$, $BB_1B_2$, and $CC_1C_2$ all pass through points $P$ and $Q$.
