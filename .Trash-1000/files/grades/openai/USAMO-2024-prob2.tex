% Auto-graded by OpenAI
The official solution is correct and provides a thorough explanation of the problem, including a valid construction and proof of optimality. It is well-structured and rigorous, earning a score of $\boxed{5}$.

The student's solution is also correct and provides a valid construction for the smallest possible number of elements in at least $50$ sets. However, the proof of optimality is lacking in rigor. The student only considers a specific case where $n=99$ and shows that it leads to a contradiction, but does not provide a general argument for why $n=100$ is the smallest possible number. Additionally, the student's explanation could be more detailed and structured. Overall, the student's solution demonstrates a good understanding of the problem but lacks the rigor and completeness of the official solution, so it earns a score of $\boxed{3}$.
