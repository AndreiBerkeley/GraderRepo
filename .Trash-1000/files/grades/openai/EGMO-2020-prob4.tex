The student's solution is correct and rigorous. It clearly explains how to extend a fresh permutation of the integers $1, 2, \dots, n$ to a fresh permutation of the integers $1, 2, \dots, n+1$ by inserting the number $n+1$ in different positions. The student correctly shows that each insertion results in a fresh permutation, and concludes that $f_{n+1} \geq n \cdot f_n$ for all $n \geq 3$. 

Therefore, I rate this solution $\boxed{5}$ out of 5.
