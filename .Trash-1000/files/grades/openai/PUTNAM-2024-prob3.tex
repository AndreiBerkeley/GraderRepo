The first mistake in the student's solution is in the calculation of the total number of elements in $S$. The student incorrectly assumes that for each $j \in B$, there are $\binom{6072}{3}$ ways to choose $T(1,j)$, $T(2,j)$, and $T(3,j)$ such that $T(1,j) < T(2,j) < T(3,j)$. This assumption is incorrect because the elements in each column of $T$ must be strictly increasing, not just increasing. 

Therefore, the correct calculation for the total number of elements in $S$ should involve the hook length formula as shown in the official solution. 

Overall, I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.
