The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that $P(S_n = b) = 0$ for all even $b$ and odd $b$. This claim is incorrect because the integral of an even function over a symmetric interval is not necessarily zero, and the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is not necessarily zero either. 

Therefore, the student's solution does not correctly analyze the behavior of the integrands of $P(S_n = 0)$ and $P(S_n = b)$ for all $b$, and the conclusion that $P(S_n = 0) \geq P(S_n = b)$ for all $n$ if and only if $p = 1/2$ is not justified. 

Overall, I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.
