The overall structure of the proof is very well-organized and easy to follow. The core idea is to use the pigeonhole principle on the values a_m = S(m) - \\u230a\\u221a{S(m)}\\u230b\\u00b2, and this is executed perfectly.\\n\\nThe steps are all well-justified:\\n1. The upper bound for S(m) is correctly derived and sufficient for the argument.\\n2. The 'defect from the nearest square' term b(m) is correctly defined and bounded.\\n3. The application of the pigeonhole principle is correct, and the argument that one value of 'a' must occur many times is sound.\\n4. The choice of a large integer M and the subsequent calculations are correct and explicitly show that the number of solutions can exceed one million.\\n\\nThis is a full-credit solution. A very minor suggestion for even greater clarity would be in step 6. Instead of defining n := \\u221a{S(m)\\u2212a}, which might suggest n is a constant, it would be slightly more precise to define n_m = \\u230a\\u221a{S(m)}\\u230b for each m. Then for the m's where b(m)=a, the pair (m, n_m) is a solution. This is a tiny point of notation in what is otherwise a flawless proof.\"\n}\n```"
