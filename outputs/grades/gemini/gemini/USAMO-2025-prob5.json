The problem is a number theory problem asking to find all positive integers $k$ such that for every positive integer $n$, the sum $\\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{i}^k$ is divisible by $n+1$.\\n\\nThe provided text is a solution to a functional equation problem (likely seeking functions $f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying an equation like $f(x-f(y)) = f(f(x)) - yf(x) + f(y)$). While the reasoning for the functional equation problem appears structured, it is unfortunately completely unrelated to the number theory problem at hand.\\n\\nConsequently, no points can be awarded. The score is 0.\\n\\nFor future reference, a way to approach the actual problem would be:\\n1.  **Test small values of n.** For example, for $n=2$, the condition becomes $2+1 | \\\\binom{2}{0}^k + \\\\binom{2}{1}^k + \\\\binom{2}{2}^k$. This simplifies to $3 | 1^k + 2^k + 1^k = 2 + 2^k$. For this to be true, $2^k \\\\equiv -2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 3$, which forces $k$ to be an even number. This gives a necessary condition on $k$.\\n2.  **Prove sufficiency.** The more challenging part is to prove that if $k$ is any even positive integer, the condition holds for all $n$. This usually involves modular arithmetic properties of binomial coefficients, such as considering prime factors of $n+1$. For a prime $p$ dividing $n+1$, one can use the property that $\\\\binom{n}{i} \\\\pmod p$ behaves cyclically.\"\n}\n```"
