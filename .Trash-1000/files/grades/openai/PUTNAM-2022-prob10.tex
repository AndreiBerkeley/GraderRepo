I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the student's solution is assuming that $d_1 = d_2 = d_3$. The official solution shows that the common differences $d_1, d_2, d_3$ can be different, and in fact, they are not equal in general. This mistake leads to an incorrect conclusion that the common difference of each arithmetic progression is $1$.
