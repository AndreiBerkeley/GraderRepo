The first mistake in the student's solution is the conclusion that $S_k(n) \equiv S_k(n+1) \pmod{n+1}$. This conclusion is not valid based on the information given in the problem. The student incorrectly assumes that $S_k(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{n+1}$ for all positive integers $n$, which is not necessarily true.

Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect.

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
