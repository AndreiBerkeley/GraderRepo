I would rate this solution a 2.

The first mistake in the solution is the assumption that Bob has a winning strategy. The official solution actually proves that Alice has a winning strategy by showing that the roads constructed according to the conditions in the problem statement satisfy the requirements for Alice to win the game. Therefore, the conclusion that Bob has a winning strategy is incorrect.

Additionally, the solution does not provide a rigorous proof that Bob's strategy satisfies the conditions for Alice to win the game. The explanation for each case is not detailed enough to ensure that the conditions are met for all possible cities placed by Bob.

Overall, the solution is incomplete and reaches an incorrect conclusion, so it does not deserve a high rating.
