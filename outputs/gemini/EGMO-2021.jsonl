The equation becomes:\n$$x f(1) = 1 f(x)$$\n$$f(x) = f(1) \\cdot x$$\nLet $c = f(1)$, which is a fixed constant. Then the function must be of the form:\n$$f(x) = cx$$\nThis derivation is valid for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To be fully rigorous, we note that if we pick any $y_0 \\neq 0$, then $f(x) = \\frac{f(y_0)}{y_0}x$. The constant $c = \\frac{f(y_0)}{y_0}$ is independent of the choice of $y_0$, because for any other $y_1 \\neq 0$, we have $y_1 f(y_0) = y_0 f(y_1)$, which implies $\\frac{f(y_0)}{y_0} = \\frac{f(y_1)}{y_1}$. The case where $f(y)=0$ for all $y \\neq 0$ is included by setting $c=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the solution**\nWe must check if the functions of the form $f(x)=cx$ satisfy the original equation for any constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe original equation is $f(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(f(x) + f(y))$.\n\nSubstitute $f(x)=cx$ into the left-hand side (LHS):\n$$LHS = f(x^2 - y^2) = c(x^2 - y^2)$$\n\nSubstitute $f(x)=cx$ into the right-hand side (RHS):\n$$RHS = (x-y)(f(x) + f(y)) = (x-y)(cx + cy)$$\n$$RHS = c(x-y)(x+y) = c(x^2 - y^2)$$\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the equation holds for any function of the form $f(x)=cx$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of all functions satisfying the given equation is $f(x) = cx$ for any constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$."}

It relies on the symmetry properties of the sine function.\n\n**Step 1: Define the general term**\nLet the general term of the summation be denoted by $f(k)$:\n$$f(k) = \\sin^3\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the terms**\nWe will investigate the relationship between the terms $f(k)$ and $f(3600-k)$. The number $3600$ is chosen because the argument of the sine function, $\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}$, completes a full cycle of $2\\pi$ as $k$ goes from $0$ to $3600$.\n\nLet's evaluate $f(3600-k)$:\n$$f(3600-k) = \\sin^3\\left(\\frac{(3600-k)\\pi}{1800}\\right) = \\sin^3\\left(\\frac{3600\\pi}{1800} - \\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) = \\sin^3\\left(2\\pi - \\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right)$$\nWe use the trigonometric identity $\\sin(2\\pi - x) = -\\sin(x)$. Applying this identity, we get:\n$$f(3600-k) = \\left[\\sin\\left(2\\pi - \\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right)\\right]^3 = \\left[-\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right)\\right]^3$$\n$$f(3600-k) = -\\sin^3\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) = -f(k)$$\nThis gives us a crucial symmetry property:\n$$f(k) + f(3600-k) = 0$$\n\n**Step 3: Pair the terms in the sum**\nWe can now pair the terms in the sum $S$ from opposite ends. The sum is from $k=1$ to $k=3599$.\n$$S = f(1) + f(2) + \\dots + f(1799) + f(1800) + f(1801) + \\dots + f(3598) + f(3599)$$\nLet's group the terms into pairs $(f(k), f(3600-k))$:\n$$S = \\big[f(1) + f(3599)\\big] + \\big[f(2) + f(3598)\\big] + \\dots + \\big[f(1799) + f(1801)\\big] + f(1800)$$\nEach of these pairs sums to zero due to the symmetry property we found:\n$$f(k) + f(3600-k) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } k=1, 2, \\dots, 1799$$\nThus, the sum simplifies to:\n$$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{1799} \\big[f(k) + f(3600-k)\\big] + f(1800) = \\sum_{k=1}^{1799} 0 + f(1800) = f(1800)$$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the middle term**\nThe only term that was not part of a pair is the middle term, $f(1800)$. Let's evaluate it:\n$$f(1800) = \\sin^3\\left(\\frac{1800\\pi}{1800}\\right) = \\sin^3(\\pi)$$\nSince $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, we have:\n$$f(1800) = 0^3 = 0$$\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nCombining our results, we find that the sum is zero.\n$$S = 0$$\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Using Trigonometric Identity (Linearization)\n\nThis method involves using a trigonometric identity to reduce the power of the sine function.\n\n**Step 1: Linearize the `sin^3` term**\nWe use the triple angle identity for sine: $\\sin(3x) = 3\\sin(x) - 4\\sin^3(x)$.\nRearranging this identity gives us a formula for $\\sin^3(x)$:\n$$\\sin^3(x) = \\frac{3\\sin(x) - \\sin(3x)}{4}$$\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the identity into the sum**\nLet $x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{1800}$. The sum $S$ becomes:\n$$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{3599} \\frac{1}{4}\\left[3\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) - \\sin\\left(\\frac{3k\\pi}{1800}\\right)\\right]$$\nWe can split this into two separate sums:\n$$S = \\frac{3}{4}\\sum_{k=1}^{3599} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k=1}^{3599} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{600}\\right)$$\nLet's call these sums $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$$S_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{3599} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{3599} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{600}\\right)$$\nSo, $S = \\frac{3}{4}S_1 - \\frac{1}{4}S_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the sum S1**\nWe can use the same symmetry argument as in Method 1. Let $g(k) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right)$.\nThen $g(3600-k) = \\sin\\left(2\\pi - \\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) = -\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{1800}\\right) = -g(k)$.\n$$S_1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{3599} g(k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{1799} [g(k) + g(3600-k)] + g(1800) = \\sum_{k=1}^{1799} 0 + \\sin(\\pi) = 0$$\nThus, $S_1 = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the sum S2**\nLet $h(k) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{600}\\right)$. The period of $h(k)$ with respect to integer $k$ is found by setting the argument change to $2\\pi$: $\\frac{N\\pi}{600} = 2\\pi \\implies N=1200$. So, $h(k+1200) = h(k)$.\nThe sum for $S_2$ runs from $k=1$ to $3599$. This is nearly three full periods of $1200$.\n$$S_2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{3599} h(k) = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{1200} h(k)\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{k=1201}^{2400} h(k)\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{k=2401}^{3599} h(k)\\right)$$\nFirst, let's evaluate the sum over one full period:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{1200} h(k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{1199} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{600}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{1200\\pi}{600}\\right)$$\nThe last term is $\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$. The sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{1199} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{600}\\right)$ is zero by the same symmetry pairing argument (pairing $k$ with $1200-k$; the middle term is $k=600$, for which $\\sin(\\pi)=0$). Thus, $\\sum_{k=1}^{1200} h(k) = 0$.\n\nThe second block is $\\sum_{k=1201}^{2400} h(k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{1200} h(j+1200) = \\sum_{j=1}^{1200} h(j) = 0$.\nThe third block is $\\sum_{k=2401}^{3599} h(k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{1199} h(j+2400) = \\sum_{j=1}^{1199} h(j) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $S_2 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nSubstituting the values of $S_1$ and $S_2$ back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{3}{4}(0) - \\frac{1}{4}(0) = 0$$\n\nBoth methods rigorously show that the value of the sum is 0."}
{"id": "egmo-2021-q3", "solution": "Here is a complete and rigorous solution to the problem.\n\n### The Problem\n\nLet $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two circles with centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ respectively, and let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be their radii. The two circles intersect at points $A$ and $B$. Let $CD$ be a common external tangent to the two circles, with $C$ on $C_1$ and $D$ on $C_2$. Let $M$ be the intersection of the line $AB$ and the line $CD$. Prove that $MC = MD$.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proof relies on the fundamental concept of the power of a point with respect to a circle and the properties of the radical axis of two circles.\n\n**Step 1: Define Power of a Point and Radical Axis**\n\nThe **power of a point** $P$ with respect to a circle $\\mathcal{C}$ with center $O$ and radius $r$ is defined as $\\text{Pow}(P, \\mathcal{C}) = PO^2 - r^2$. The power of a point is a fundamental quantity in geometry with several important properties.\n\nOne key property is that if $P$ is an external point to the circle, and a line through $P$ is tangent to the circle at a point $T$, then the power of $P$ is equal to the square of the length of the tangent segment from $P$ to the circle. That is:\n$$ \\text{Pow}(P, \\mathcal{C}) = PT^2 $$\n\nThe **radical axis** of two circles, $C_1$ and $C_2$, is the locus of all points $P$ that have equal power with respect to both circles. That is, the set of points $P$ such that:\n$$ \\text{Pow}(P, C_1) = \\text{Pow}(P, C_2) $$\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical Axis in the Given Problem**\n\nA standard theorem in geometry states that for two intersecting circles, their radical axis is the line passing through their intersection points.\n\nIn this problem, the circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect at points $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the line passing through $A$ and $B$, which is the line $AB$, is the radical axis of $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\nTo see why, let $P$ be any point on the line $AB$. A line through $P, A, B$ intersects circle $C_1$ at $A$ and $B$. The power of $P$ with respect to $C_1$ is given by the product of the signed distances from $P$ to the intersection points, which is $\\text{Pow}(P, C_1) = \\vec{PA} \\cdot \\vec{PB}$. Similarly, the same line intersects circle $C_2$ at the same points $A$ and $B$, so the power of $P$ with respect to $C_2$ is $\\text{Pow}(P, C_2) = \\vec{PA} \\cdot \\vec{PB}$. Thus, for any point $P$ on the line $AB$, $\\text{Pow}(P, C_1) = \\text{Pow}(P, C_2)$, confirming that line $AB$ is the radical axis.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Properties of Point M**\n\nThe point $M$ is defined as the intersection of the line $AB$ and the line $CD$.\nSince $M$ lies on the line $AB$, and the line $AB$ is the radical axis of $C_1$ and $C_2$, it follows from the definition of the radical axis that the power of $M$ with respect to $C_1$ is equal to the power of $M$ with respect to $C_2$.\n$$ \\text{Pow}(M, C_1) = \\text{Pow}(M, C_2) $$\n\n**Step 4: Express the Power of M using the Tangent Line**\n\nThe line $CD$ is a common tangent to both circles. The point $M$ lies on this line.\n*   For circle $C_1$, the line $CD$ is tangent at point $C$. Since $M$ is a point on this tangent line, the length of the tangent segment from $M$ to $C_1$ is the distance $MC$.\n    According to the property of the power of a point, we have:\n    $$ \\text{Pow}(M, C_1) = MC^2 $$\n*   Similarly, for circle $C_2$, the line $CD$ is tangent at point $D$. The length of the tangent segment from $M$ to $C_2$ is the distance $MD$.\n    Thus, we have:\n    $$ \\text{Pow}(M, C_2) = MD^2 $$\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Proof**\n\nBy combining the equations from Step 3 and Step 4, we get:\n$$ MC^2 = MD^2 $$\nSince $MC$ and $MD$ are lengths, they must be non-negative real numbers. Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$ MC = MD $$\nThis proves that $M$ is the midpoint of the segment $CD$.\n\n### Summary of the argument:\n1.  The line $AB$ is the radical axis of circles $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n2.  The point $M$ lies on the radical axis $AB$, so it has equal power with respect to both circles: $\\text{Pow}(M, C_1) = \\text{Pow}(M, C_2)$.\n3.  The power of $M$ with respect to $C_1$ is $MC^2$, as $MC$ is the tangent segment from $M$ to $C_1$.\n4.  The power of $M$ with respect to $C_2$ is $MD^2$, as $MD$ is the tangent segment from $M$ to $C_2$.\n5.  Equating the powers gives $MC^2 = MD^2$, which implies $MC=MD$."}

Prove that the lines $CM$ and $AN$ are perpendicular.\"\n\nThere appears to be a typographical error in the problem statement. Let's analyze the statement as it is.\n\n### Analysis of the Original Problem Statement\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system to analyze the geometry. Let the line $AB$ be the x-axis and the line $CH$ be the y-axis. Let $H$ be the origin $(0,0)$.\nSince $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$ in the right triangle $ABC$ must be acute, $H$ lies between $A$ and $B$. We can set the coordinates of the vertices without loss of generality:\n* $H = (0,0)$\n* Let $AH = a$ and $BH = b$ for some $a,b > 0$. Then $A = (-a, 0)$ and $B = (b, 0)$.\n* Let $CH=c$ for some $c > 0$. So $C = (0, c)$.\n\nThe points $A, M, H, N, B$ are all on the line segment $AB$, which is the x-axis in our coordinate system.\n* $M$ is the midpoint of $AH$. The coordinates of $M$ are $\\left(\\frac{-a+0}{2}, \\frac{0+0}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0\\right)$.\n* $N$ is the midpoint of $BH$. The coordinates of $N$ are $\\left(\\frac{b+0}{2}, \\frac{0+0}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{2}, 0\\right)$.\n\nWe want to prove that the lines $CM$ and $AN$ are perpendicular.\n* The line $AN$ is the line passing through $A(-a, 0)$ and $N(b/2, 0)$. Since both points lie on the x-axis, the line $AN$ is the x-axis itself. The slope of $AN$ is $m_{AN}=0$.\n* The line $CM$ is the line passing through $C(0, c)$ and $M(-a/2, 0)$.\n\nFor $CM$ to be perpendicular to $AN$ (the x-axis), $CM$ must be a vertical line. This would require the x-coordinates of $C$ and $M$ to be the same. The x-coordinate of $C$ is $0$ and the x-coordinate of $M$ is $-a/2$.\nFor them to be equal, we must have $-a/2 = 0$, which implies $a=0$.\n$a=AH$, so $a=0$ means $A=H$. If $A=H$, the triangle $\\triangle AHC$ is degenerate. In $\\triangle ABC$, this would mean that the altitude from $C$ is the side $AC$, so $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$.\nHowever, the triangle $ABC$ is given to be right-angled at $C$, so $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$. A triangle cannot have two right angles. The only way this is possible is in a degenerate triangle where $B$ and $C$ coincide, which is not a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement as written is incorrect for any non-degenerate triangle.\n\n### Corrected Problem Statement and Solution\n\nA common and very similar problem has a slight modification in the definition of one of the midpoints. The most likely intended problem is the following, where the \"A\" in \"AH\" is replaced by a \"C\":\n\n**Corrected Problem:** Given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at $C$. Let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the segment **CH** and $N$ be the midpoint of the segment $BH$. Prove that the lines $AM$ and $CN$ are perpendicular.\n\nWe will now provide a rigorous proof for this corrected statement. We can use vector algebra, which provides an elegant solution.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system with the vertex $H$ at the origin $(0,0)$. Let the line $AB$ be the x-axis and the line $CH$ be the y-axis.\n* $H = (0,0)$.\n* Let $A = (-a, 0)$ and $B = (b, 0)$ for some $a,b > 0$.\n* Let $C = (0, c)$ for some $c > 0$.\n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$. The position vectors of the vertices relative to the origin $H$ are $\\vec{a} = (-a,0)$, $\\vec{b} = (b,0)$ and $\\vec{c} = (0,c)$.\nThe vectors representing the sides $AC$ and $BC$ are:\n$\\vec{CA} = \\vec{a} - \\vec{c} = (-a, -c)$\n$\\vec{CB} = \\vec{b} - \\vec{c} = (b, -c)$\n\nSince $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, the vectors $\\vec{AC}$ and $\\vec{BC}$ are perpendicular. (Note: using $\\vec{CA}$ and $\\vec{CB}$ is equivalent). Their dot product must be zero.\n$\\vec{AC} \\cdot \\vec{BC} = 0$\n$(\\vec{c}-\\vec{a}) \\cdot (\\vec{c}-\\vec{b}) = 0$\n$(a, c) \\cdot (-b, c) = 0$\n$a(-b) + c(c) = 0 \\implies -ab + c^2 = 0 \\implies c^2 = ab$.\nThis relation is the well-known geometric mean theorem for right triangles ($CH^2 = AH \\cdot BH$).\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of $M$ and $N$ based on the corrected problem statement.\n* $M$ is the midpoint of $CH$. $C=(0,c), H=(0,0)$. So, $M = \\left(\\frac{0+0}{2}, \\frac{c+0}{2}\\right) = \\left(0, \\frac{c}{2}\\right)$.\n* $N$ is the midpoint of $BH$. $B=(b,0), H=(0,0)$. So, $N = \\left(\\frac{b+0}{2}, \\frac{0+0}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{2}, 0\\right)$.\n\nWe need to prove that the lines $AM$ and $CN$ are perpendicular. We can do this by showing that the dot product of their direction vectors is zero.\n* The direction vector for the line $AM$ can be represented by $\\vec{AM} = \\vec{M} - \\vec{A}$.\n$\\vec{A} = (-a, 0)$ and $\\vec{M} = (0, c/2)$.\n$\\vec{AM} = (0 - (-a), c/2 - 0) = (a, c/2)$.\n\n* The direction vector for the line $CN$ can be represented by $\\vec{CN} = \\vec{N} - \\vec{C}$.\n$\\vec{C} = (0, c)$ and $\\vec{N} = (b/2, 0)$.\n$\\vec{CN} = (b/2 - 0, 0 - c) = (b/2, -c)$.\n\nNow, we compute the dot product of $\\vec{AM}$ and $\\vec{CN}$:\n$\\vec{AM} \\cdot \\vec{CN} = (a, c/2) \\cdot (b/2, -c)$\n$= a\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)(-c)$\n$= \\frac{ab}{2} - \\frac{c^2}{2}$\n\nUsing the relation $c^2=ab$ that we derived earlier:\n$\\vec{AM} \\cdot \\vec{CN} = \\frac{ab}{2} - \\frac{ab}{2} = 0$.\n\nSince the dot product of the direction vectors of the lines $AM$ and $CN$ is zero, the lines are perpendicular.\n\nThis completes the proof for the corrected problem statement."}

To determine the number of real roots, we can analyze the behavior of the function $P(x)$ using calculus.\n\n1.  **Find the critical points:** We start by finding the derivative of $P(x)$ and setting it to zero to find the critical points.\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x^2 + 1) = 3x^2 - 6x$.\n    Setting $P'(x) = 0$:\n    $3x^2 - 6x = 0$\n    $3x(x - 2) = 0$\n    The critical points are $x=0$ and $x=2$.\n\n2.  **Determine the nature of the critical points:** We can use the second derivative test to classify these points as local maxima or minima.\n    $P''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 - 6x) = 6x - 6$.\n    *   At $x=0$: $P''(0) = 6(0) - 6 = -6 < 0$, which indicates a local maximum.\n    *   At $x=2$: $P''(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 6 > 0$, which indicates a local minimum.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the function at the critical points:**\n    *   The local maximum value is $P(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 1 = 1$.\n    *   The local minimum value is $P(2) = (2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 1 = 8 - 12 + 1 = -3$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the end behavior and apply the Intermediate Value Theorem:**\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $P(x) \\to -\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $P(x) \\to \\infty$.\n\n    Now we combine these results:\n    *   The function comes from $-\\infty$, increases to a local maximum of $P(0)=1$. Since it goes from negative values to a positive value, there must be a root $x_1$ in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$.\n    *   The function then decreases from the local maximum $P(0)=1$ to the local minimum $P(2)=-3$. Since it goes from a positive value to a negative value, there must be a second root $x_2$ in the interval $(0, 2)$.\n    *   Finally, the function increases from the local minimum $P(2)=-3$ towards $\\infty$. Since it starts from a negative value and increases indefinitely, there must be a third root $x_3$ in the interval $(2, \\infty)$.\n\nSince we have found three roots in three disjoint intervals, the three real roots $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are distinct.\n\n### Part 2: Evaluating the expression\n\nLet $x_1, x_2, x_3$ be the three distinct real roots of $P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0$.\nLet $y_1, y_2, y_3$ be the roots of the equation $P(y-1) = 0$.\n\n1.  **Relating the roots $y_i$ to $x_i$:**\n    The equation $P(y-1)=0$ means that $y-1$ is a value that, when plugged into $P$, gives zero. By definition, the values for which $P$ is zero are the roots $x_1, x_2, x_3$.\n    Therefore, the set of values $\\{y_1-1, y_2-1, y_3-1\\}$ must be the same as the set of roots $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$.\n    This implies that the roots are related by $y_i - 1 = x_j$ for some pairing of indices $(i, j)$.\n    So, the set of roots of $P(y-1)=0$ is $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\} = \\{x_1+1, x_2+1, x_3+1\\}$.\n\n2.  **Pairing of the roots:**\n    The problem asks for the value of $(x_1 + y_1)(x_2 + y_2)(x_3 + y_3)$. This expression's value could depend on how we pair the $x_i$'s with the $y_i$'s. A standard interpretation in such problems is that the indices correspond. We can establish this correspondence formally. Let's order the roots of $P(x)$ as $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$.\n    Let $f(t) = t+1$. The roots of $P(y-1)=0$ are $y_i = f(x_j)$ for some permutation. Since $f(t)$ is a strictly increasing function, we have $x_1+1 < x_2+1 < x_3+1$. If we order the roots $y_i$ as $y_1 < y_2 < y_3$, the natural and unique pairing is $y_i = x_i+1$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n    We assume this natural pairing, so $y_1 = x_1+1$, $y_2 = x_2+1$, and $y_3 = x_3+1$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the expression:**\n    We need to find the value of $E = (x_1 + y_1)(x_2 + y_2)(x_3 + y_3)$.\n    Substituting $y_i = x_i+1$:\n    $E = (x_1 + (x_1+1))(x_2 + (x_2+1))(x_3 + (x_3+1))$\n    $E = (2x_1 + 1)(2x_2 + 1)(2x_3 + 1)$\n\n    To evaluate this expression, we can relate it to the polynomial $P(x)$.\n    Since $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are the roots of $P(x)$, we can write $P(x)$ in factored form:\n    $P(x) = (x-x_1)(x-x_2)(x-x_3)$.\n\n    Let's manipulate the expression for $E$:\n    $E = (2x_1 + 1)(2x_2 + 1)(2x_3 + 1)$\n    $E = 2\\left(x_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot 2\\left(x_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot 2\\left(x_3 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$\n    $E = 8\\left(x_1 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\left(x_2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\left(x_3 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)$\n\n    This expression is almost in the form of $P(x)$ evaluated at a specific point. Let's adjust the signs:\n    $E = 8 \\cdot (-1)^3 \\left(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - x_1\\right)\\left(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - x_2\\right)\\left(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - x_3\\right)$\n    $E = -8 \\left[\\left(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - x_1\\right)\\left(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - x_2\\right)\\left(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - x_3\\right)\\right]$\n\n    The term in the square brackets is exactly the definition of $P(-1/2)$.\n    So, $E = -8 \\cdot P(-1/2)$.\n\n    Now, we just need to calculate $P(-1/2)$:\n    $P\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 1$\n    $P\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{8} - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 1$\n    $P\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{3}{4} + 1$\n    $P\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{8}{8}$\n    $P\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\n    Finally, we can compute $E$:\n    $E = -8 \\cdot P(-1/2) = -8 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -1$.\n\n### Alternative Method using Vieta's Formulas\n\nWe can also calculate $E = (2x_1 + 1)(2x_2 + 1)(2x_3 + 1)$ by expanding it and using Vieta's formulas.\nFor $P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 0x + 1 = 0$, Vieta's formulas give us the sums of the products of the roots:\n*   $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -(-3)/1 = 3$\n*   $x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3 = 0/1 = 0$\n*   $x_1x_2x_3 = -1/1 = -1$\n\nExpanding the expression for $E$:\n$E = (2x_1+1)(2x_2+1)(2x_3+1)$\n$E = (4x_1x_2 + 2x_1 + 2x_2 + 1)(2x_3 + 1)$\n$E = 8x_1x_2x_3 + 4x_1x_2(1) + 4x_1x_3(1) + 4x_2x_3(1) + 2x_1(1) + 2x_2(1) + 2x_3(1) + 1$\n$E = 8(x_1x_2x_3) + 4(x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3) + 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) + 1$\n\nNow, substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n$E = 8(-1) + 4(0) + 2(3) + 1$\n$E = -8 + 0 + 6 + 1$\n$E = -1$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that $P(x)=x^3-3x^2+1$ has three distinct real roots. By establishing a natural pairing between the roots of $P(x)=0$ and $P(y-1)=0$, we found the value of the expression $(x_1 + y_1)(x_2 + y_2)(x_3 + y_3)$ to be **-1**."}
