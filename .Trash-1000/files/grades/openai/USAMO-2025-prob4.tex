The candidate solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the reasoning when concluding that $A$, $H$, $P$, $F$, and $C$ are concyclic. This conclusion is not justified by the given information and is incorrect.

Therefore, the candidate solution is not fully correct and rigorous. I would rate it a 3 out of 5.
