The candidate solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the calculation of the probability of the first case happening. The candidate incorrectly assumes that the probability of \( X_n \) being the largest element in the zigzag sequence is \( \frac{1}{n} \). This assumption is incorrect because the largest element in the zigzag sequence is not necessarily \( X_n \). The correct probability should take into account all possible positions of \( X_n \) within the zigzag sequence.

Therefore, the first mistake is in the calculation of the probability of the first case happening.
