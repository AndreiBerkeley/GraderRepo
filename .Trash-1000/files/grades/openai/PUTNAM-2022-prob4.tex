The first mistake in the student's solution is in the calculation of the expected value of \( S \) when \( k = n \). The correct calculation should be
\[ E[S \mid k = n] = E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i}{2^i} \right] = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{E[X_i]}{2^i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right). \]
Therefore, the expected value of \( S \) when \( k = n \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \), not \( \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^{n}}\right) \) as calculated by the student.

Overall, the student's solution is incorrect and lacks rigor in the calculation of the expected value. I would rate it a 1 out of 5.
