I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the solution is the claim that $AXDY$ is cyclic. This claim is not justified and is incorrect. The fact that $\angle AYD = \angle AXD = 90^\circ$ does not imply that $AXDY$ is cyclic. In fact, $AXDY$ is not necessarily cyclic, so the subsequent reasoning based on this incorrect claim is invalid.
