  "feedback": "The argument is correct up to Step 4, but Step 5 contains a decisive error. For n = 6k+2 the constructed number n' = 24k+9 satisfies n' > n (indeed n' âˆ’ n = 18k+7 > 0) and also n' > 3n, so it is not smaller than n. Therefore the minimal-counterexample contradiction fails and the proof does not establish that every positive integer is linked to 2021. Without this step the conclusion that 2021^{2021} is fantabulous is not justified."
