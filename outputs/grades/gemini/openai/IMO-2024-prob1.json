The solution is well-structured and most of the steps are correct. However, there is a significant logical flaw in the core argument used to prove that the fractional part of $\\alpha$ must be zero.\n\nThe initial setup, including the check for even integers and the reformulation of the problem in terms of $T_n$ and $u_n$, is flawless. The analysis of the sequence $u_n$ and the derivation of the bound on its variation (inequality (5)) are also correct and insightful. The case distinction based on the parity of $t = \\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor$ is also spot on.\n\nThe main issue lies in Section 5, where the contradiction is derived. You correctly establish that for $\\beta \\neq 0$, the difference $f_{n+1} - f_n$ gets arbitrarily close to the non-zero constant $\\beta/2$ for large $n$. You then try to show that this is incompatible with the required behavior of the fractional part of $f_n$. This is where the error occurs:\n\n1.  In case A, you state that since $f_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 1$, \"we would have $f_n$ constantly 0, so every difference is 0\". This is incorrect. $f_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 1$ means that $f_n$ is an integer for all $n$, not necessarily the *same* integer. Therefore, the difference $f_{n+1} - f_n$ must be an integer. The correct contradiction arises because for large $n$, $f_{n+1} - f_n$ is close to $\\beta/2$. Since we assume $0 < \\beta < 1$, we have $0 < \\beta/2 < 1/2$. A number that is arbitrarily close to a value in $(0, 1/2)$ cannot be an integer.\n\n2.  In case B, you claim that because $\\{f_n\\}$ alternates between 0 and 1/2, \"|f_{n+1}−f_n| is either 0 or ½\". This is a confusion between the sequence $f_n$ and its fractional part $\\{f_n\\}$. It is true that $|\\{f_{n+1}\\} - \\{f_n\\}| = 1/2$ for all $n$. However, $f_{n+1} - f_n = (\\lfloor f_{n+1} \\rfloor - \\lfloor f_n \\rfloor) + (\\{f_{n+1}\\} - \\{f_n\\})$. Since the second term alternates between $\\pm 1/2$, the full difference $f_{n+1} - f_n$ is not restricted to be $1/2$. A correct argument would be to note that for large $n$, $|f_{n+1} - f_n|$ must be close to $\\beta/2$. But $|f_{n+1} - f_n| = |\\text{integer} \\pm 1/2| \\ge 1/2$. This implies $\\beta/2 \\ge 1/2$, so $\\beta \\ge 1$, which contradicts $\\beta < 1$.\n\nDespite these errors in the final steps of the argument for $\\beta \\neq 0$, the overall strategy is brilliant and the conclusion that $\\beta=0$ is correct. The final part of the proof, which shows that an integer $\\alpha$ must be even, is also correct. Because the central part of the argument contains a significant logical flaw, the solution cannot be considered complete, but it represents major progress and deep insight into the problem.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"The solution presents a brilliant and original approach. It successfully identifies the set of solutions and most of the reasoning is correct. However, the key argument to rule out non-integer solutions contains a significant logical flaw, where the student confuses a sequence with its fractional part. The overarching idea is sound, but the execution of the proof is not fully correct.\",\n  \"score\": 5,\n  \"feedback\": \"Your solution is very creative and the analytic approach is impressive. The reformulation in Section 2 and the analysis of the sequence `u_n` are excellent.\\n\\nThe main issue is in Section 5. When arguing for a contradiction, you confuse the sequence `f_n` with its fractional part `{f_n}`.\\n- In case A, `f_n` must be an integer for all `n`, not necessarily 0. The contradiction comes from `f_{n+1}-f_n` being an integer, while for large `n` it must be close to `β/2 ∈ (0, 1/2)`, which is not an integer.\\n- In case B, your claim `|f_{n+1}−f_n|` is 0 or 1/2 is incorrect. The correct argument is that `|f_{n+1}-f_n|` must be close to `β/2` but at the same time `|f_{n+1}-f_n| = |integer ± 1/2| ≥ 1/2`. This would imply `β ≥ 1`, a contradiction.\\n\\nDespite this flaw, your high-level strategy is sound and leads to the correct conclusion that `β=0`. The final part of your argument (Section 6) is perfectly correct. This is a very strong paper that demonstrates deep mathematical understanding, but the gap in the proof for the non-integer case prevents it from receiving a higher score.\"\n}\n```"
