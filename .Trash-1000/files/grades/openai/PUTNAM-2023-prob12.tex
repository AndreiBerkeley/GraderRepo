I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that the number of solutions to $ax + by = k$ is given by $\binom{k+d-1}{d-1}$. This is incorrect. The correct formula for the number of nonnegative integer solutions to $ax + by = k$ is given by $\left\lfloor \frac{k}{\gcd(a,b)} \right\rfloor + 1$ if $k$ is a multiple of $\gcd(a,b)$ and $0$ otherwise.

Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect from this point onwards, and the rest of the solution is based on this incorrect claim.
