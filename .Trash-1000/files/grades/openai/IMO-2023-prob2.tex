I would rate this solution a 4.

The first mistake in the solution is the claim that $ASTD$ is cyclic. This claim is incorrect because $\angle AST$ is not necessarily equal to $\angle ADE$. In fact, $ASTD$ is not cyclic in general.

However, the rest of the solution is correct. The student correctly shows that $MDLB$ is cyclic, $BL$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$, and $NP$ is tangent to $\omega$. The student also correctly concludes that the line tangent to $\omega$ at $P$ meets line $BS$ on the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.
