The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the candidate's solution where they incorrectly set $f(x) = e^{rx}$ and $g(x) = e^{rx}$. The problem states that $f'(x) = g(x)$, not $f'(x) = g'(x)$. The correct interpretation is that the derivative of $f$ at $x$ is equal to the value of $g$ at $x$, not the derivative of $g$ at $x$. Therefore, the candidate's choice of functions $f(x) = e^{rx}$ and $g(x) = e^{rx}$ does not satisfy the given conditions, and their solution is invalid.
