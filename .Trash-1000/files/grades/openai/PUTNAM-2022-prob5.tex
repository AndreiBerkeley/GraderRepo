The candidate solution is incorrect. The first mistake is the assumption that Alice can always ensure that Bob cannot place a tile that covers both squares of the tile she placed. This assumption is not true, as Bob can place a tile that covers both squares of Alice's tile if the two squares have the same parity. This mistake leads to an incorrect conclusion about the maximum number of uncovered squares that Alice can ensure at the end of the game. 

Therefore, the candidate solution is not rigorous and does not provide a correct solution to the problem. I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
