Let's consider the parity of the number of turns in the game. Since there are $n$ turns in total, the parity of the number of turns is the same as the parity of $n$. 

If Bob chooses the goal of ``odd'', then he wins if the number of turns is odd, which means $n$ is odd.

If Bob chooses the goal of ``even'', then he wins if the number of turns is even, which means $n$ is even.

Therefore, Bob has a winning strategy for all odd $n$ and no winning strategy for even $n$. 

In conclusion, Bob has a winning strategy for all odd values of $n$.
