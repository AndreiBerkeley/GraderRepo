The candidate solution is incorrect. The first mistake is the assumption that all roots of $P(x) = 0$ are non-negative integers. This assumption is not necessarily true, as the coefficients of $P$ are non-negative integers, but the roots themselves can be complex numbers. Therefore, the candidate solution is flawed from the beginning and does not lead to a correct solution. 

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
