The student's solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the calculation of the number of attempts needed. The student claims that Turbo can guarantee reaching the last row in at most $2022$ attempts, but this is incorrect.

The correct number of attempts needed can be found in the official solution, which shows that Turbo needs at least $3$ attempts to guarantee reaching the last row. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ such that Turbo has a strategy which guarantees being able to reach the bottom row in at most $n$ attempts is $n = 3$.

I would rate this solution a 4 out of 5.
