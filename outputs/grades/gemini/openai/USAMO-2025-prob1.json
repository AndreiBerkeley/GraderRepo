However, the proof is incomplete as it fails to handle the lowest-order digit, and a key step in the final argument is based on a flawed premise about the number of digits.\",\n  \"score\": 5,\n  \"feedback\": \"The core of your argument, which is to find a lower bound for the digits $a_i$, is very creative and well-executed for the cases $i \\\\ge 1$. The analysis of $q_i = \\\\lfloor n^{k-i}/2^i \\\\rfloor$ by writing it as $ns + b_i$ is excellent. This correctly leads to the crucial inequality $a_i \\\\ge b_i$ (for $i \\\\ge 1$), and from there to $a_i \\\\ge \\\\lfloor n/2^i \\\\rfloor$. This is the most difficult part of this approach, and you handled it very well.\\n\\nHowever, the proof has two significant flaws which prevent it from being a complete solution:\\n\\n1.  **The case i=0 is not covered:** Your argument to establish the lower bound for $a_i$ relies on a decomposition that is only valid for $i \\\\ge 1$. Specifically, writing $r = 2^i s + t$ with $0 < t < 2^i$ is not possible when $i=0$. The digit $a_0 = n^k \\\\pmod{2n}$ must be handled as a separate case. For odd $n$, it can be shown that $a_0=n$, and thus we need $n>d$.\\n\\n2.  **The uniform lower bound is derived incorrectly:** In part 3, you state that $a_i \\\\ge \\\\lfloor n / 2^k \\\\rfloor$ for every digit. This step appears to be based on the incorrect assumption that the digit index $i$ can go up to $k$. For a sufficiently large integer $n$, the base-$2n$ expansion of $n^k$ has exactly $k$ digits, indexed from $i=0$ to $i=k-1$. Therefore, the uniform lower bound for all digits (from your method for $i \\\\ge 1$) should be derived from the highest index, $k-1$, giving $a_i \\\\ge \\\\lfloor n/2^{k-1} \\\\rfloor$. Your bound of $\\\\lfloor n/2^k \\\\rfloor$ is weaker, but happens to be sufficient to complete the proof. However, the reasoning to get there is flawed.\\n\\nBecause you successfully solved the most complex part of the problem but left a case unproven and made a significant error in the concluding argument, the solution is awarded 5 points out of 7.\"\n}\n```"
