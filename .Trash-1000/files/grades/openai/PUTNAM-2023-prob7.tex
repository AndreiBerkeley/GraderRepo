The student's solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the statement "the number of distinct configurations of coins that can be reached starting from the initial configuration is the product of the number of distinct configurations in the upper part and the number of distinct configurations in the lower part." This is not true because the configurations in the upper and lower parts are not independent. The movement of coins in one part can affect the movement of coins in the other part, as shown in the official solution.

Therefore, the student's solution does not provide a correct method for determining the number of distinct configurations of coins that can be reached starting from the initial configuration. The correct answer is $\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}$ as given in the official solution.

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
