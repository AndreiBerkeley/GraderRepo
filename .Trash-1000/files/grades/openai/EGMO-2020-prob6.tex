The first mistake in the student's solution is the assumption that $b_n = r^n$ for some constant $r$. This assumption is incorrect because the characteristic equation $r^2 - mr + 1 = 0$ has complex roots for most values of $m$. Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect from this point onwards. The correct approach involves finding the roots of the characteristic equation and using them to express $b_n$ in terms of $m$ and $n$.
