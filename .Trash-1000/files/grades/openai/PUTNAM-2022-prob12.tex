The student's solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the conclusion. The student incorrectly concludes that there are no solutions to the functional equation, when in fact there are solutions. The mistake occurs when the student claims that there are no such functions $f$ after showing that $f(d\cdot c) = 1$. This conclusion is incorrect because the student did not consider all possible functions that satisfy the given functional equation. The correct conclusion should be that the only such functions are $f(x) = \frac{1}{1+cx}$ for some $c \geq 0$. 

Overall, I would rate this solution a 4 out of 5.
