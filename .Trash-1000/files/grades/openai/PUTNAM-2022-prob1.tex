I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the assumption that the line $y = ax + b$ intersects the curve $y = \ln(1+x^2)$ in exactly one point if and only if the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are equal to $1$ and $0$ respectively. This assumption is incorrect.

The correct approach is to substitute $y = ax + b$ into $y = \ln(1+x^2)$ to get $ax + b = \ln(1+x^2)$. Then, we need to solve this equation to find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the condition that the line intersects the curve in exactly one point. The solution should involve solving for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $x$, and not making any premature assumptions about the values of $a$ and $b$.
