Let's consider the following strategy for Turbo:

1. Turbo starts at any cell in the first row.
2. Turbo moves to the cell in the second row that is in the same column as the cell he is currently in.
3. Turbo moves to the cell in the third row that is in the same column as the cell he is currently in.
4. Turbo continues this pattern until he reaches the last row.

With this strategy, Turbo can guarantee reaching the last row in at most $2022$ attempts. Here's why:

- In the worst-case scenario, Turbo encounters a monster in each of the $2022$ rows from the second row to the second-to-last row. In this case, Turbo will be transported back to the first row $2022$ times.
- On the $2023$rd attempt, Turbo will reach the last row without encountering any monsters, as there are no monsters in the last row.

Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ such that Turbo has a strategy which guarantees being able to reach the bottom row in at most $n$ attempts is $n = 2022$.
