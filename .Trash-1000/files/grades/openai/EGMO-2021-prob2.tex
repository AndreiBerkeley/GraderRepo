The student's solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the step where they conclude that $f$ is injective. The mistake occurs in the line:

\[ f(-xf(x)) = -x^2 \]

This step does not imply that $f$ is injective. To show injectivity, we need to show that if $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$, then $a = b$. The student's solution does not address this, so the conclusion that $f$ is injective is not justified. 

Therefore, I would rate this solution a 4 out of 5.
