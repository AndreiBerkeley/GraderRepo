The first mistake in the student's solution is in the calculation of the derivative of $g(x)$. The correct derivative should be
\begin{align*}
g'(x) &= n^2 x^{n^2-1} e^{-1/(1-x)} + x^{n^2} e^{-1/(1-x)} \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\
&= x^{n^2-1} e^{-1/(1-x)} (n^2 - \frac{n^2x}{1-x}).
\end{align*}
The mistake is in the term $\frac{1}{1-x}$, which should be $\frac{n^2x}{1-x}$.

Overall, the student's solution is clear and well-structured, but the mistake in the derivative calculation affects the subsequent analysis of the limit. Therefore, I would rate this solution a 3.
