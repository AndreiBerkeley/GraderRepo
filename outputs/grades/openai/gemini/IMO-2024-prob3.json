  "feedback": "The submission discusses operations that add one term to another to reduce the number of distinct values of a finite list. It never analyzes the given recursively-defined infinite sequence, nor addresses the requirement to show that one of the even- or odd-indexed subsequences is eventually periodic. Consequently it does not prove any part of the stated problem."
