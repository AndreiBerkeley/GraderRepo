{"id": "egmo-2020-q6", "solution": "Let's denote $b_n = a_{n+1}$. Then the given recursive relation becomes\n$$b_{n+1} = mb_n - b_{n-1}.$$\nWe are given that $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 4$. We want to find all $m > 1$ such that $b_n$ is a perfect square for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nLet's first find the characteristic equation of the linear recurrence relation $b_{n+1} = mb_n - b_{n-1}$. Assume $b_n = r^n$ for some constant $r$. Substituting this into the recurrence relation, we get\n$$r^{n+1} = mr^n - r^{n-1} \\implies r^2 = mr - 1.$$\nThis gives us the characteristic equation $r^2 - mr + 1 = 0$. The roots of this characteristic equation are given by\n$$r = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}.$$\n\nSince $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 4$, we have $b_n = \\frac{r^n - s^n}{r - s}$, where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the characteristic equation. We know that $b_n$ must be a perfect square for all $n \\geq 1$. This implies that $r$ and $s$ must be integers, as otherwise the expression for $b_n$ will not be an integer for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nSince $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 4$, we have $r + s = m$ and $rs = 1$. Thus, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - mx + 1 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $m$ and the product of the roots is $1$. Therefore, the roots are the solutions to the equation $x^2 - mx + 1 = 0$, which are given by\n$$x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}.$$\n\nFor $b_n$ to be a perfect square for all $n \\geq 1$, both $r$ and $s$ must be integers. This implies that the discriminant $\\Delta = m^2 - 4$ must be a perfect square. Hence, we need to find all $m > 1$ such that $m^2 - 4 = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSolving $m^2 - 4 = k^2$ gives $(m-k)(m+k) = 4$. The factors of $4$ are $(1,4)$ and $(-1,-4)$. So, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $(m-k,m+k) = (1,4)$\nSolving this system gives $m = 3$.\n\nCase 2: $(m-k,m+k) = (-1,-4)$\nSolving this system gives $m = -3$, but since $m > 1$, this case is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only integer $m > 1$ for which the sequence $(a_n)_{n\\ge1}$ contains only perfect squares is $m = 3$."}
