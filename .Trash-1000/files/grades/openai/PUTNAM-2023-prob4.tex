I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that $w$ is a linear combination of the vectors $v_1, \dots, v_{12}$ with non-negative coefficients that sum to $-1$. This is not correct, as the coefficients in a convex combination must be non-negative. 

Therefore, the subsequent argument based on this incorrect claim is also flawed. The rest of the solution is based on this flawed reasoning, so the conclusion reached at the end is not valid.
