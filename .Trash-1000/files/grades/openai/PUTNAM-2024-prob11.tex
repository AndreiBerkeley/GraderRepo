The student's solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the calculation of the sum of binomial coefficients. The correct expression for \( f(n) \) should be

\[
f(n) = \sum_{z=1}^{n} \binom{z}{k} \binom{z}{m} = \sum_{z=1}^{n} \frac{z!}{k!(z-k)!} \cdot \frac{z!}{m!(z-m)!}.
\]

The student incorrectly calculated the product of the binomial coefficients as a product of the numerators and denominators separately. This mistake leads to an incorrect expression for \( f(n) \) and subsequently to an incorrect conclusion about the polynomial having nonnegative coefficients. 

Therefore, I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.
