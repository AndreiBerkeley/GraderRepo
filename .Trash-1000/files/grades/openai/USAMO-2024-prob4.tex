The first mistake in the student's solution is in the inequality $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \leq mn-b$. The student incorrectly assumes that the sum of the distinct numbers of red beads in the blocks must be less than or equal to the total number of red beads $r$ in the necklace. However, this assumption is not correct because the sum of the distinct numbers of red beads in the blocks does not necessarily equal the total number of red beads in the necklace.

Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect from the beginning and does not lead to the correct answer. The correct answer is $m \leq n+1$, as shown in the official solution. The student's solution does not provide a valid proof for this result. 

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
