The student's solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the reasoning when proving that $AFDI$ is cyclic.

The first mistake occurs when the student claims that $\angle AFD = \angle AID$. This is incorrect because $\angle AFD = \angle ACD \neq \angle AID$. 

Therefore, the conclusion that $AFDI$ is cyclic is not valid based on the given reasoning. 

I would rate this solution a 3 out of 5.
