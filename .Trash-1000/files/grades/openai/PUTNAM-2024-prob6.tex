I would rate this solution a 3. 

The first mistake in the student's solution is the incorrect computation of the determinant of the submatrices $A_{ij}$. The student incorrectly computed the determinants of the submatrices by directly expanding along the first row, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach involves using the properties of determinants, such as linearity and the Laplace expansion formula, to compute the determinants of the submatrices. 

Overall, the student correctly identified the form of the coefficients $c_k$ and attempted to compute the determinant of the matrix $A$ using the correct method of expanding along the first row. However, the mistake in computing the determinants of the submatrices significantly impacts the correctness and rigor of the solution.
