The student's solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the statement "Since the product $a_0 a_1 \cdots a_k$ is zero, at least one of $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k$ must be zero." This is not true. It is possible for the product of non-zero real numbers to be zero if one of the numbers is non-real. Therefore, the conclusion that at least one of $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k$ must be zero is not valid.

Overall, the student's solution lacks a correct understanding of the problem and does not provide a valid argument for the conclusion. I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
