The first mistake in the student's solution is in Case 1. The student incorrectly concludes that Case 1 is not possible by assuming without loss of generality that \(a = 1\). This assumption is not valid as the problem statement explicitly states that \(n\) is composite, so both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1.

Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect from the beginning. The correct approach is to consider the case where \(n\) has at least two distinct prime divisors, as shown in the official solution. 

Overall, the student's solution is not correct, so I would rate it 1 out of 5.
