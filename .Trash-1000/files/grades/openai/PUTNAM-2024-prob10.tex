The first mistake in the student's solution is the conclusion that $E(n) = 1$ for all $n$. This is incorrect because the expected value of $a_{n,n}$ is not necessarily equal to $1$ for all $n$. The correct expected value is given by the official solution as $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$.

Therefore, I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
