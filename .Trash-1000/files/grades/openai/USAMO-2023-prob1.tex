The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that $OA = OB$ because $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$. This claim is not necessarily true, as the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABP$ does not necessarily lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$. Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect from the beginning. 

Overall, I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
