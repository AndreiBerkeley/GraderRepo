Let's denote the given quadrilaterals as $ABCD$ and $ABCE$ where $E$ is the reflection of $D$ across the perpendicular bisector of diagonal $\overline{AC}$. Let $O$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AC}$.

Since $E$ is the reflection of $D$ across the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AC}$, we have $\angle AED = \angle AOD$ and $\angle EAD = \angle OAD$. This implies that triangles $\triangle AED$ and $\triangle AOD$ are congruent by ASA (angle-side-angle) criterion. Therefore, we have $AD = AE$ and $ED = OD$.

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral $ABCD$. Since $AD = AE$ and $ED = OD$, we have $AD = AE = OD = ED$. This implies that quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a rhombus.

Let's denote the side length of the rhombus $ABCD$ as $x$. Since $ABCD$ is a rhombus, all its angles are right angles. Now, let's construct the next quadrilateral $ABCE$. Since $ABCD$ and $ABCE$ share three vertices, we have $AB = BC = CE = EA = x$. 

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral $ABCE$. Since $AB = BC = CE = EA = x$, we have $AB = BC = CE = EA = x$. This implies that quadrilateral $ABCE$ is a square.

Therefore, the sequence of quadrilaterals starting with a rhombus $ABCD$ and continuing with squares $ABCE$, $ABCF$, $ABCG$, $\ldots$ satisfies the given conditions. Each quadrilateral is a partner of its successor, and no two elements of the sequence are congruent.
