I would rate this solution a 4 out of 5.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that $BFEI$ and $CEFI$ are cyclic quadrilaterals. This claim is incorrect because the student did not provide a valid reason or proof for why these quadrilaterals are cyclic. In the official solution, the cyclic nature of $AEIF$ was proven by showing that $\angle FXA = \angle FIA$ and $\angle EXF = \angle EIF$.

Therefore, the student's solution is missing a crucial step in proving the cyclic nature of $BFEI$ and $CEFI$, leading to an incomplete solution.
