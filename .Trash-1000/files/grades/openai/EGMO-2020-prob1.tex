The candidate solution is correct and rigorous. It correctly uses modular arithmetic to show that $2^{2021} \mid 3a_{n+1}$ for all $n = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 3028$, and then concludes that $2^{2020} \mid a_1$. The solution is well-written and logically sound.

Therefore, the candidate solution deserves a full score of $\boxed{5}$.
