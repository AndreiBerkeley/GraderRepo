The strategy of using a minimal counterexample is perfect for this problem, and your write-up is exceptionally clear.\\n\\nSteps 1, 2, and 4 are brilliant. You correctly and logically prove that a minimal counterexample 'n' cannot be odd, cannot be a multiple of 3, and cannot be of the form 6k+4. This is substantial progress and correctly narrows down the problem to the most difficult case.\\n\\nThe main issue is in Step 5, which deals with the final case n = 6k+2. Your chain of transformations linking n to n' = 24k+9 is correct. However, the goal of the minimal counterexample argument is to show that n is linked to a *smaller* integer, which contradicts the minimality of n. \\n\\nYour own calculation shows that n' - n = 18k+7 > 0, which means n' > n. You then state that n' < n, which is a direct contradiction of your own finding and is a major flaw in the logic. The reasoning provided for this incorrect inequality is also faulty. This error invalidates the final, crucial step of your proof.\\n\\nA correct way to handle the n=6k+2 case is to show that any integer x is linked to 2x. Since n=2(3k+1), n would be linked to x = 3k+1. As x < n, this would lead to the desired contradiction. Proving x is linked to 2x requires a different chain of transformations than the one you used.\\n\\nOverall, this is a very strong attempt that successfully solves most of the problem. The flaw in the final step, while critical, does not diminish the quality of the rest of your work.\"\n}\n```"
