The first mistake in the student's solution is the assumption that $f(a) = a$ or $f(a) = b$ for some specific rational numbers $a$ and $b$. This assumption is not justified and does not hold in general for aquaesulian functions.

The student's solution then proceeds to make conclusions based on this incorrect assumption, leading to an incorrect final answer. The correct solution involves showing that the set $S = \{f(r) + f(-r) \mid r \in \mathbb{Q}\}$ contains at most $2$ elements, as shown in the official solution. 

Overall, I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
