I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.

The first mistake in the solution is the incorrect analysis for the case $n=5$. The candidate incorrectly states that there are two possible configurations of dominoes for $n=5$, but in fact, there is only one possible configuration that covers all but one square. The correct configuration for $n=5$ is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& & & & \\
\hline
& & & & \\
\hline
& & & & \\
\hline
& & & & \\
\hline
& & & & \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
In this case, there are $2n=10$ distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from this configuration by sliding dominoes.

Therefore, the correct possible values of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$ are $1$, $2$, and $2n$ for $n>3$.
