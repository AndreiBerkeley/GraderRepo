Your proof that these are the only solutions contains some excellent insights and the core ideas needed for a full solution. However, there are several major errors in your reasoning that prevent it from being a complete or valid proof.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of your attempt:\\n\\n**Step 1: Proving f(0)=0**\\nYour deduction that $f(f(0)+y)=f(y)$ is correct. However, your argument for why $f(0)$ must be 0 is flawed. You claim that if $f$ is periodic, it must be bounded. This is not necessarily true for a function $f: \\\\mathbb{Q} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Q}$. For example, one could define a periodic function that takes arbitrarily large values on the rationals within a single period. A correct proof for $f(0)=0$ could proceed by letting $c=f(0)$, noting $f(c)=f(0+c)=f(0)=c$, and then using the original equation with $x=c$ to get $f(c f(c) + y) = f(y) + c^2$, which simplifies to $f(c^2+y) = f(y) + c^2$. This implies $f(nc^2) = f(0)+nc^2 = c+nc^2$ for any integer $n$. But periodicity with $c$ means $f(nc^2)=f(0)=c$, so $c=c+nc^2$, which gives $nc^2=0$ for all integers $n$, forcing $c=0$.\\n\\n**Step 2: A useful translation identity**\\nThis is the strongest part of your solution. Correctly deriving $f(xf(x))=x^2$ and $f(-xf(x))=-x^2$ from $f(0)=0$ is great. The idea to define the set $T = \\\\{ xf(x) : x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} \\\\}$ and a function $h(s) = f(y+s) - f(y)$ for $s \\\\in T$ is excellent. Your proof that $h$ is additive on $T$ (in the sense that $h(s_1+s_2)=h(s_1)+h(s_2)$ for $s_1,s_2 \\\\in T$ where $s_1+s_2$ is also in $T$, and more generally $h(ns)=nh(s)$ for integer $n$) is insightful and is the key to solving the problem.\\n\\n**Step 3: The set T is all of ℚ**\\nThis is where your proof completely breaks down. Your argument `+q = ( √|q| ) f( √|q| )` requires using $x=\\\\sqrt{|q|}$. For a general rational number $q$, its square root is not rational (e.g., $\\\\sqrt{2}$). The variables in the problem are restricted to be in $\\\\mathbb{Q}$, so this step is invalid. In fact, the claim $T=\\\\mathbb{Q}$ is false for the actual solutions (for $f(x)=x$, $T$ is the set of non-negative rational squares; for $f(x)=-x$, $T$ is the set of non-positive rational squares).\\n\\n**Step 4 & 5: Determination of h and f**\\nYour argument from this point on is built on the false premise that $T=\\\\mathbb{Q}$. This makes the rest of your deduction logically invalid. Furthermore, your reasoning that $f(x)$ must be a constant multiple of $x$ because $h(t)=(t/f(x))^2$ must be well-defined is a good intuition, but it's a significant logical leap. You have correctly deduced that if $x_1f(x_1) = x_2f(x_2)$, then it must be that $x_1^2 = x_2^2$. However, you do not prove that if $f(x)/x$ is not a constant, such $x_1, x_2$ with $x_1f(x_1)=x_2f(x_2)$ and $x_1^2 \\neq x_2^2$ can be found.\\n\\n**How to fix the proof:**\\nYou were very close. The machinery you built in Step 2 is exactly what is needed. Instead of trying to show $T=\\\\mathbb{Q}$, you could have used the property $h(ns)=nh(s)$ for $s \\in T$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\\nFor any non-zero $a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$, let $s_a = af(a)$ and $s_b=bf(b)$. Since $s_a/s_b$ is a rational number, we can find non-zero integers $m,n$ such that $\\\\frac{n}{m} = \\\\frac{s_a}{s_b}$, which means $ms_a=ns_b$. Now, using your function $h$:\\n$h(ms_a) = m \\\\cdot h(s_a) = m a^2$.\\n$h(ns_b) = n \\\\cdot h(s_b) = n b^2$.\\nSince $ms_a=ns_b$, we have $h(ms_a)=h(ns_b)$, so $ma^2=nb^2$. This gives $\\\\frac{n}{m} = \\\\frac{a^2}{b^2}$.\\nComparing the two expressions for $n/m$, we get $\\\\frac{af(a)}{bf(b)} = \\\\frac{a^2}{b^2}$, which simplifies to $\\\\frac{f(a)}{a} = \\\\frac{f(b)}{b}$ for any $a,b \\neq 0$. This shows that $f(x)/x$ is a constant, which you can call $\\\\epsilon$. The rest of your argument (substituting $f(x)=\\\\epsilon x$ into the original equation) is correct and gives $\\\\epsilon = \\\\pm 1$.\\n\\nYour score of 4/7 reflects that you had the correct initial steps and developed the main tool for the proof, but failed to use it correctly and instead followed a path with fundamental errors.\"\n}\n```"
