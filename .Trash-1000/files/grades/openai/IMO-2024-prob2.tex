The first mistake in the student's solution is assuming that $\gcd(a,b)=1$ without loss of generality. This assumption is not valid because the problem specifically asks for pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$, not necessarily coprime. 

Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect. 

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
