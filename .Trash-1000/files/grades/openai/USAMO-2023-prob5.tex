I would rate this solution a 2.

The first mistake in the solution is the assumption that the sum of the numbers in each row must be equal to the sum of the numbers in each column. This assumption is not correct and does not lead to the correct conclusion.

The correct approach is to consider the residues of the numbers in each row modulo $n$. Since the numbers in each row can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression, the residues must form a complete set of residues modulo $n$. However, this does not imply that the common differences in each row are the same, as shown in the counterexample for $n=3$.
