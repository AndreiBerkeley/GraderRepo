I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that the maximum number of fat triangles is achieved when the origin is inside exactly one of the triangles formed by choosing 3 points from the set $P$. This claim is not correct. The official solution shows that the maximum number of fat triangles is achieved when the set of points forms a regular $2021$-gon containing the origin, not when the origin is inside exactly one of the triangles.

Therefore, the student's solution is incorrect and the final answer they obtained is also incorrect.
