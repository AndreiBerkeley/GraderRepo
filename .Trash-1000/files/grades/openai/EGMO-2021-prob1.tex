The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the induction step. The candidate incorrectly assumes that if $n$ is fantabulous, then $n+1$ is also fantabulous. This is not necessarily true, as the fantabulous property does not necessarily carry over to the next integer in all cases. In fact, the official solution shows that the fantabulous property does not follow this simple pattern.

Therefore, the candidate's solution is flawed and does not provide a correct proof that $2021^{2021}$ is fantabulous. I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
