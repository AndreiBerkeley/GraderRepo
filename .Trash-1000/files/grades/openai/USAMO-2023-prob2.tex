The student's solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the step where the student concludes that $f(y) = f(y+f(1))-2$ for all $y>0$. This conclusion is not valid because the student incorrectly applied the functional equation $f(y+f(1)) = f(y) + 2$ to obtain this result. The correct application of the functional equation should yield $f(y+f(1)) = y + 2$.

Therefore, the student's solution is flawed from this point onwards, and the final conclusion that $f(x) = 2$ for all $x>0$ is incorrect.

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
