The student's solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is assuming that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a rhombus. Just because $AD = AE$ and $ED = OD$ does not imply that $ABCD$ is a rhombus. In fact, the quadrilateral $ABCD$ could be any convex quadrilateral that satisfies the given conditions. The rest of the solution is based on this incorrect assumption, so the solution is not valid.

Therefore, I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
