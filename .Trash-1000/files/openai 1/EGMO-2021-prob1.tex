Let's prove that the number \(2021^{2021}\) is fantabulous.

First, we note that \(2021\) is fantabulous.  
Next, we will show that if \(n\) is fantabulous, then \(n+1\) is also fantabulous.  
Suppose \(n\) is fantabulous. Then, we have three cases to consider:
1. If \(n = m\), then \(2n+1 = 2m+1\) and \(3n = 3m\). Since \(m\) is fantabulous, \(2m+1\) and \(3m\) are also fantabulous. Hence, \(n+1 = m+1\) is fantabulous.
2. If \(n = 2m+1\), then \(2n+1 = 4m+3\) and \(3n = 6m+3\). Since \(2m+1\) is fantabulous, \(4m+3\) and \(6m+3\) are also fantabulous. Hence, \(n+1 = 2m+2\) is fantabulous.
3. If \(n = 3m\), then \(2n+1 = 6m+1\) and \(3n = 9m\). Since \(3m\) is fantabulous, \(6m+1\) and \(9m\) are also fantabulous. Hence, \(n+1 = 3m+1\) is fantabulous.

Therefore, by induction, all positive integers are fantabulous.

Since \(2021\) is fantabulous, then \(2021^{2021}\) is also fantabulous.
