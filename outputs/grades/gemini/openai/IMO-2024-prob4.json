It seems you may have been searching for a purely synthetic proof. Remember that any correct mathematical proof, regardless of its type (synthetic, algebraic, coordinate-based, etc.), is valid and can receive full marks. If you have a partial or complete solution using other methods, you should always write it down.\\n\\nAs there is no mathematical content in your current submission, I cannot award any points, so the score is 0.\\n\\nFor a synthetic approach to this problem, a good starting point is to simplify one of the angles. The angle ∠KIL involves the incenter I and midpoints K, L. This structure is often simplified by a homothety. Consider the homothety with center A and ratio 2. It maps L to B and K to C. The image of I under this homothety is a point T which happens to be the reflection of A across I. This transformation shows that △KIL is similar to △CTB, and thus ∠KIL = ∠CTB.\\n\\nThis key step transforms the problem into proving ∠CTB + ∠YPX = 180°. The new point T is also very useful for understanding the geometry of X and Y. I encourage you to explore its properties. Keep trying!\"\n}\n```"
