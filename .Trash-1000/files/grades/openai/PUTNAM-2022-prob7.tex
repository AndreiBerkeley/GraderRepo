The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that the coefficient of $x^k$ in $P(x)^k$ is odd for all $k \geq 1$. This claim is incorrect because the coefficient of $x^k$ in $P(x)^k$ is not necessarily odd for all $k \geq 1$. 

Therefore, the student's solution is not fully correct and rigorous. I would rate it a 2 out of 5.
