  "feedback": "The answer states that Bob has the winning strategy, while the official solution proves Alice always wins.  \n\nFor the case S = ℝ² the student shows Bob can create a crossing, which is true, but irrelevant because Alice is free to choose another S.  \n\nFor S ≠ ℝ² the inductive construction is flawed: to block an edge AB it is necessary to find a city C for which *no* point R in S makes ΔPQR directly similar to ΔABC or ΔBAC.  The student only guarantees that there exists a city C whose corresponding R₀ lies outside S, but does not exclude the possibility that the *other* similarity (or another R) lies inside S; hence a road AB may still be built.  Consequently the strategy does not prevent edges and does not prove Bob’s win.  \n\nBecause the final result is wrong and the supporting argument is invalid, no partial credit is awarded."
