I would rate this solution a 4.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( DE \) at point \( B \). This claim is incorrect because the student did not provide a valid reason or proof for this assertion. In fact, the quadrilateral \( ABDE \) being cyclic does not imply that \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( DE \) at point \( B \).
