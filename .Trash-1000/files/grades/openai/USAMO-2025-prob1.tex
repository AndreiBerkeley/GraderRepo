I would rate this solution a 4 out of 5.

The first mistake in the student's solution is the claim that for $n$ sufficiently large, $\left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i}}{2} \right\rfloor > d$ and $2\left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i-1}}{2} \right\rfloor \leq 2d$ implies that the $i$-th digit of the base-$2n$ representation of $n^k$ is greater than $d$ for all sufficiently large $n$. This claim is not necessarily true because the student did not consider the possibility that the difference between $\left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i}}{2} \right\rfloor$ and $2\left\lfloor \frac{n^{k-i-1}}{2} \right\rfloor$ could be less than $d$.

The student's solution correctly identifies the key idea of looking at the coefficients of powers of $2n$ in the expansion of $n^k$, but the mistake in the reasoning prevents a full score.
