The candidate solution is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the reasoning when showing that $P$ is the incenter of triangle $CDE$. The mistake is in the statement:

"Since $\angle DCP = \angle ACO$ and $CP = CA$, we have $DP = DA$."

This statement is incorrect because having equal angles and equal side lengths does not imply that the two triangles are congruent. In this case, $\angle DCP = \angle ACO$ and $CP = CA$ do not guarantee that $DP = DA$. 

Therefore, the candidate solution is not fully correct and rigorous. I would rate it a 3 out of 5.
