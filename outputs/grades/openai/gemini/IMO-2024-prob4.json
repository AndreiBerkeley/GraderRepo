  "score": 0,
  "feedback": "The submission discusses mixtilinear-incircle properties, points D, E, F, L_b, L_c, and tries to show that a point G coincides with the incenter I—an entirely different statement from the one posed. No argument is given for the required relation  ∠KIL + ∠YPX = 180°. Hence the solution does not address, let alone prove, the problem’s claim."
