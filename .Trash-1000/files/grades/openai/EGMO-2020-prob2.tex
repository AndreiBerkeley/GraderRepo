I would rate this solution a 2.

The first mistake in the solution is the assumption that $y_i = x_{i+k}$ for some fixed $k$. The problem states that there exists a permutation $(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{2020})$ of $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{2020})$ such that the given equation holds. The candidate solution incorrectly assumes a fixed $k$, which is not necessarily true.

Additionally, the candidate solution does not fully utilize the given inequality in the official solution, which is crucial for solving the problem. The candidate solution attempts to expand and simplify the equation without making use of the inequality provided in the official solution.
