The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake in the candidate solution is the assumption that $v \times w = \lambda(v \times w)$ implies $(1-\lambda)(v \times w) = 0$. This is not true in general. The candidate solution then incorrectly concludes that $\lambda = 1$, leading to the incorrect conclusion that $v \times w = v \times w$ for all $v, w \in S$.

Overall, the candidate solution lacks a rigorous argument and makes incorrect assumptions about the properties of the cross product.
