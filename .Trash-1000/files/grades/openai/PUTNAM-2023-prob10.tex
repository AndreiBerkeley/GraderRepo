I would rate this solution a 2.

The first mistake in the student's solution is that they did not consider the function $f(t) = n$ for $t \geq t_n$. This means that they missed out on calculating the integral over the interval $[t_{n-1}, t_n]$.

Additionally, the student's solution lacks a clear explanation of how to determine the values of $t_i$ and how to compute the sum $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i(t_{i+1} - t_i)$. The solution would benefit from a more detailed and rigorous explanation of these steps.
