Let $f(x) = e^{rx}$ and $g(x) = e^{rx}$. We have $f'(x) = re^{rx}$ and $g'(x) = re^{rx}$. 

To satisfy the given conditions, we need to find the smallest positive real number $r$ such that $f'(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This gives us the equation $re^{rx} = e^{rx}$.

Dividing both sides by $e^{rx}$ (which is nonzero for all $x$), we get $r = 1$. Therefore, the smallest positive real number $r$ that satisfies the conditions is $r = 1$.
