The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the statement "Since \( p \) is prime, we have \( p \) does not divide \( b! \)." This is not true in general. For example, when \( b = p \), \( p \) does divide \( b! \). 

Therefore, the candidate solution is flawed from this point onwards, and the conclusion drawn at the end is invalid. The candidate solution does not provide a complete and correct solution to the problem. 

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
