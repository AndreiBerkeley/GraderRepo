The problem is about distributing $m$ cupcakes to $n$ people based on their scoring systems. The solution you have written solves a completely different problem, which appears to be: 'Find all positive integers $n$ for which there exists a permutation $\\\\sigma$ of the set $\\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, n\\\\}$ such that the set $\\\\{i + \\\\sigma(i) \\\\mid i \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, \\\\dots, n\\\\}\\\\}$ contains exactly two distinct values.'\\n\\nWhile your solution to this other problem is well-structured, clear, and appears to be correct, it is completely unrelated to the question posed. In an exam setting, solving the wrong problem, no matter how well, receives no points towards the intended problem. Therefore, the score is 0.\\n\\nPlease double-check that you are solving the correct problem in the future.\\n\\nFor your reference, the actual problem is a combinatorial existence problem. The official solution uses Hall's Marriage Theorem on a bipartite graph, combined with an iterative argument and induction. The core of the argument is to handle sets of people for whom a direct matching fails (sets that violate Hall's condition).\"\n}\n```"
