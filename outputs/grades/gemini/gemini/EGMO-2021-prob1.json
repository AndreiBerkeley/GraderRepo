The problem statement, however, is about a property of positive integers called 'fantabulous'. It's a number theory problem that requires logical deduction based on the given rules.\\n\\nThe student's solution, while a well-structured and correct walkthrough for the functional equation f(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(f(x) + f(y)), has no connection to the question asked. The problem does not define any function f(x), nor does it involve variables x and y. \\n\\nTo solve the actual problem, one should use the properties given:\\n1. 2021 is fantabulous.\\n2. For any positive integer m, the property of being 'fantabulous' holds for all elements of {m, 2m+1, 3m} if it holds for any one of them. This can be written as F(m) <=> F(2m+1) <=> F(3m).\\n\\nThe goal is to determine if one can deduce that 2021^2021 is fantabulous.\\n\\nSince the submission does not address the given problem at all, it cannot receive any points.\"\n}\n```"
