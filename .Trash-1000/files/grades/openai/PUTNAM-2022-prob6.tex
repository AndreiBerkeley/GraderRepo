The student's solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the statement "This implies that the sum of the absolute differences of consecutive \(x_i\) is 1." This conclusion is not correct. The fact that the sum of the absolute differences of consecutive \(x_i\) is 1 does not necessarily imply that the \(x_i\) are equally spaced.

Therefore, the student's solution does not provide a correct argument for determining the largest integer \(m\). 

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
