I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the solution is the assumption that $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent in the circle. This assumption is not justified and leads to an incorrect conclusion. The correct approach is to use the given condition that the product of any two neighbors is of the form $x^2 + x + k$ to derive properties about the primes $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ without assuming their adjacency.

The solution should focus on using the properties of the numbers of the form $x^2 + x + k$ to deduce constraints on the placement of the primes around the circle, rather than making assumptions about their adjacency.
