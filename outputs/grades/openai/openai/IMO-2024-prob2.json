  "feedback": "The argument breaks down in two essential places.\n1. From the congruences d|(ab−1), d|b(a−1), d|a(b−1) you assert that d divides a and b.  This is not justified: one can only deduce d|(a−1) and d|(b−1).  The later bound d≤2 and the rest of the proof rely on the false statement d|a, d|b.\n2. In Section 5 the use of LTE is flawed.  For odd n, v₂(n)=0, so choosing n=2^m+1 does not make v₂(n) large; consequently the conclusion that v₂(d_n) is unbounded is invalid.\nBecause the crucial step d≤2 is not established, the exclusion of all pairs except (1,1) is not proved. The solution therefore is incomplete."
