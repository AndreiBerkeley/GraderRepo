The student's solution is incorrect. The mistake is in assuming that the parity of the number of turns in the game is the same as the parity of $n$. This assumption is not true because Alice can choose any number from $1$ to $n$ on each turn, so the number of turns in the game is not necessarily equal to $n$. 

Therefore, the student's solution does not provide a correct analysis of the problem and does not lead to the correct conclusion. 

I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
