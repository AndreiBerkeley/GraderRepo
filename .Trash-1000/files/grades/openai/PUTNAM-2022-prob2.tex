The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the statement "To maximize the number of negative coefficients, we need to make the coefficients \( a_n, a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \ldots, a_1, a_0 \) as negative as possible." This is not true. Maximizing the number of negative coefficients does not necessarily mean making all coefficients as negative as possible. The official solution provides a counterexample to this claim by constructing a polynomial with $2n-2$ negative coefficients.

Therefore, the candidate solution is not rigorous and does not provide a correct approach to solving the problem. I would rate it 1 out of 5.
