The first mistake in the student's solution is the assumption that $p(x)$ can be written as $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$. This assumption is incorrect because the problem does not specify the degree of the polynomial $p(x)$. The correct approach is to let $r(x) = p(x) - x$ and work with $r(x)$ instead.

The student's solution then proceeds to incorrectly conclude that $n=2$ based on the assumption above, which leads to the incorrect final answer. The correct answer is $p(x) = \pm x + c$ for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$, as shown in the official solution.

I would rate this solution a 2 out of 5.
