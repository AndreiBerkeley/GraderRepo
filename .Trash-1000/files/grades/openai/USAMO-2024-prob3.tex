The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in assuming that each color must have a total area of $A/(n-2)$. This assumption is not correct because the areas of the triangles are not necessarily equal. The problem requires that each color has an equal sum of areas, not necessarily equal areas for each triangle. 

Therefore, the candidate solution is not rigorous and does not provide a correct approach to the problem. I would rate this solution a 1 out of 5.
