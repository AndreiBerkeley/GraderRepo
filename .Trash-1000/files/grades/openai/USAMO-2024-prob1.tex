The candidate solution is incorrect.

The first mistake is in the statement "This implies that for each \( i \), we must have \( b_{i2} - b_{(i-1)2} \geq 0, b_{i3} - b_{(i-1)3} \geq 0, \dots, b_{im} - b_{(i-1)m} \geq 0 \)." This conclusion is not correct because the terms \( p_1^{b_{i2}-b_{(i-1)2}} p_2^{b_{i2}-b_{(i-1)2}} \cdots p_m^{b_{im}-b_{(i-1)m}} - 1 \) are not necessarily non-negative. 

Therefore, the candidate solution is flawed and does not lead to a correct solution.
