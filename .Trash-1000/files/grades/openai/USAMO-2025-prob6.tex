I would rate this solution a 3.

The first mistake in the student's solution is in the step where they claim that for each person $i$, we have
\begin{align*} S_i' &= \sum_{j=1}^{m} s_{i,j} \geq \sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{s_{i,j}}{w_j} \cdot w_j = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{s_{i,j}}{w_j} \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \\ &\geq \left(\sum_{j=1}^{m} \sqrt{\frac{s_{i,j}}{w_j}}\right)^2 \geq \left(\sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{1}{\sqrt{w_j}}\right)^2 = m^2 \end{align*}
The mistake here is that the student incorrectly applies the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any sequences of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \ldots + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \ldots + b_n^2).\]
In this case, the student incorrectly applies the inequality by taking square roots on the right side without justification.
