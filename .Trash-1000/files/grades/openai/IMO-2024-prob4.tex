I would rate this solution a 2.

The first mistake in the solution is the repetition of the same reasoning multiple times without providing any new insights or progress towards the solution. This repetition makes the solution unnecessarily long and does not contribute to the solution of the problem. Additionally, the solution lacks a clear structure and organization, making it difficult to follow the logic.
